This improved capability translates directly into greater value to the end users of these sensors.</p>\n<p>The 3N163 P-Channel enhancement mode MOSFET was designed originally for front-end amplification of gas detection sensors. The part has been a key design option when high speed and low parasitic capacitance are important in circuit design. Linear Systems’ ability to produce these parts with approximately half the noise of those previously available makes these parts the best design choice for a wide range of systems, including radiation detection sensors, dosimeters, electrometers and ultra-high-impedance amplifiers.</p>\n<p>Linear Systems also offers its lower-noise dual version, the 3N165 monolithic dual P-Channel enhancement mode MOSFET, and its 3N170 and 3N171 N-Channel enhancement mode small-signal MOSFETs to provide a wide range of options for designers.</p>\n<p>The Linear Systems 3N163 has since proven to be highly versatile and capable sensor amplifier for applications ranging from piezoelectric accelerometers to radiation detectors. The front-end amplification is one of the most critical aspects of sensor system design, McCune said. Our Improved Standard Product 3N163 provides world-class capability at a relatively low price.</p>\n<p>Linear Systems provides electrical selections of the 3N163 for threshold voltage and other parameters. In quantities over 100,000 pieces of the non-selected part, significant volume pricing is available. The part is available in TO-72, SOT143 and bare die form.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"3N163 Featured","date":"May 01, 2015","description":"Hello World","thumbnailImageUrl":"https://www.linearsystems.com/lsdata/images/Blog%20-%203N163.jpg"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/military-sensors-whitepaper-/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Military Sensors White Paper"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/linear-systems-partners-with-digi-key/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linear Systems partners with Digi-Key"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"413e0ede-c786-5036-85c8-325e21e5006b","previousPostId":"872de3fe-1454-532d-a3e7-f601d1194f0c","nextPostId":"34cbd730-799d-5c83-a9cf-8e651292f11c"}},
