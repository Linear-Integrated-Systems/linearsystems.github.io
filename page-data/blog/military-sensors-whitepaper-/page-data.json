This improved capability translates directly into greater value to the end users of these sensors.”</p>\n<p>Linear Systems is a designer, manufacturer and seller of precision, high-performance, small-signal discrete semiconductors. A Silicon Valley company founded in 1987, it produces ultra-low-noise, monolithic dual and single JFETs and bipolar transistors, along with high-speed DMOS switches, small-signal MOSFETs, ultra-low leakage diodes and BiFET amplifiers. These parts have been designed into world-class products in the areas of: Test &#x26; Measurement, Audio, Scientific Optical, Military Sensor; Industrial Controls; and Hybrids.</p>\n<p>The White Paper can be downloaded at:</p>\n<p>High-Performance Military Sensor Signal Chains</p>\n<p>Data sheets, applications notes, SPICE models and other information can be downloaded at <a href=\"http://www.linearsystems.com\">www.linearsystems.com</a>.</p>\n<p>For More Information:</p>\n<p>Call Linear Systems toll free phone number: (800) 359-4023, regular business line: (510) 490-9160 or fax: (510) 353-0261.</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:sales@linearsystems.com\">sales@linearsystems.com</a> Website: <a href=\"http://www.linearsystems.com\">www.linearsystems.com</a></p>\n<p>SOURCE Linear Integrated Systems</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Military Sensors White Paper","date":"May 01, 2015","description":"","thumbnailImageUrl":"https://www.linearsystems.com//lsdata/images/Military%20Sensor.jpg"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/nelson-pass/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interview with Nelson Pass"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/linear-systems-launches-improved-standard-product-3n163-family/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"3N163 Featured"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"872de3fe-1454-532d-a3e7-f601d1194f0c","previousPostId":"36bf22ef-3c84-505d-bab1-f18f76e09b6b","nextPostId":"413e0ede-c786-5036-85c8-325e21e5006b"}},
